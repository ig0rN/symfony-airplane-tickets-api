# Introduction #
The goal of this assignment is to create minimal airplane ticket reservations systems.
You are free to change / improve features, as well as implement more features you feel should benefit the system.
This app should be a proof of concept, with special accent to the business logic, however other things can be mocked or just mentioned in comments.

We would preffer this solution to be implemented using Symfony Framework (or just symfony components) and use git for version control.

# Task #
Implement minimal and useful API for an airplane ticket management system. This management system is a service used by 3rd party (external) systems.

One airplane ticket should contain flight departure time, source and destination airport as well as passenger seat which should be a random number (between 1 and 32) per flight and passengerâ€™s passport ID.

API should support following operations:

* Create new Ticket
* Cancel Ticket

# Bonus task #
Implement this additional API operation

* Change Seat for Ticket

# Additional requirements #
Please include instructions on how to run the project and use the API.
